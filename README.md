# Embedded Notes

This is a collection of notes and ideas I adhere to when working on embedded systems.

They are the result of my experience working with companies big and small. I hope they serve as inspiration to fellow engineers looking to formalize their processes. Feel free to take whatever you find useful and adapt it to your use-case.
